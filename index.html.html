<p><strong>WE ARE THE BRIGHT ONE!</strong></p>
<p>In this application, we are tasked to create a informational webpage about the strand in Senior High School here in the Philippines and we chose STEM (Science, Technology, Enginneering and Mathematics). This website that we created will help every people and youth because this contains information, ideas and visuals about this strand.
We created this application so it can mold or shape our minds a better understanding about this Strand such as what is the STEM strand, what are the skills and requirements and why choosing strand is important especially for the upcoming Senior High School students.</h3>

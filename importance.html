<ul>
<li>Choosing a strand expands your knowledge and skills, while at the same time, exposing you to your chosen field of study in preparation for college. It practices the skills and capabilities of the students. And the students are being prapared for what they will face in the chosen course</li>
<li>Choosing a strand is very important and necessary especially  to the youth, in choosing a strand you can only choose once, so be wise in choosing. When choosing a strand you have to base it on your personality, the things you love to do and the things that you can do and i believe that we should decide what ever we like and have a better future.</li>

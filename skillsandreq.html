<p>When we talk about STEM skills, we’re talking about the individual skills needed to do science, mathematics, and engineering, and those needed to use technology effectively.</p>

<ol>
<li>Problem Solving - 
STEM problems require you to quickly work to make sense of problems as they are presented, and work productively to propose real and appropriate solutions.</li>
<li>Creativity - 
STEM requires the ability to look at and propose solutions to a problem through multiple approaches, including ones that are highly creative or “out-of-the-box.” In STEM, mistakes and failed attempts are positive experiences, offering opportunities for deeper learning.</li>
<li>Inquiry Skills -
STEM requires hands-on, active participation to effectively solve problems. Students are the drivers of solutions and should be asking the questions, proposing the ideas, generating and testing solutions, and making decisions based on data to understand how to refine ideas further.</li>
<li>Math & Science Skills - 
The mathematics and science skills you are learning in school are the foundation of STEM and must be applied in pursuit of solutions. The math and science used to solve problems will connect to and extend your coursework, as well as highlight connections between ideas and subject areas.</li>
<li>Critical Thinking - 
Effective STEM learning requires you to analyze information, evaluate designs, reflect on your thinking, synthesize new ideas, and propose creative solutions. All of these skills are vital to becoming an independent, critical thinker.</li>

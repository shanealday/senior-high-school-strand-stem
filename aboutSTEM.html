<ul>
<li>Do you keep seeing STEM on websites, schools and leaflets but you’re not entirely sure what it means? Don’t worry, we’re here to explain what is STEM means and why it’s becoming one of the most talked-about subject areas in Senior High School.</li>
<li>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Strand Curriculum.
The senior high school STEM strand provides a deep dive into hard sciences including Earth Science, Pre-Calculus and Basic Calculus, and Physics. These subjects will serve as preparation for students’ future undergraduate programs.
</li>
<li>It refers to any subjects that fall under these four disciplines. Because these things are never straightforward, there are also dozens of alternative versions of STEM (including STEAM, STREAM and METALS) but STEM is by far the most widely-used.</li>
<li>The acronym originates from discussions about the lack of qualified graduates to work in high-tech jobs in the US. Since its creation, governments and universities around the world have made attracting students to STEM courses a priority, in order to address this shortfall. In some cases, it’s also easier to immigrate to another country if you studied a STEM subject at degree level and are looking for work in that field.</li>
<li>The STEM strand is designed to nurture senior high school students’ curiosity, problem solving abilities, and communication skills. With the STEM strand, graduates will:

Have developed a keener sense of creativity and ingenuity which is essential in coming up with new ideas and innovations
Be more inclined to experiment and be more open to risks
Be able to apply the knowledge they’ve learned in class in everyday scenarios, most especially in their future courses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What courses are under STEM?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a list of some of the other STEM courses you could choose:</p>
<li>Aerospace engineering</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Biochemistry</li>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemical engineering</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Civil engineering</li>
<li>computer engineering</li>
<li>Computer science</li>
<li>Computer network architecture</li>
<li>Electrical engineering</li>
